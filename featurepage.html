  <p>Hi and welcome to my features page this is a whole list of my top
  favorite shows. I would list all my favorite shows but that would take up
  alot of space. so the first picture you see is "The Flash"
  I like this show because of the characters, the abilities some 
  of tem have, and the plot.The second picture you see "Supernatural"
  this show is so popular that it`s got at least 13 seasons crasy right?
  but sadly I`v only see a few episodes but if your in to the
  spooky,thrilling, and fantacy this is the show to watch.
  NOW! last picture is my favorite show because it is a mix of 
  spooky, thrill, romance and fantacy but I`ll let you watch it for yourself
  and ou see why I like it. But if your a person who can`t watch 
  stuff like this or you have heart problems don`t watch this .
